== Blurring images with macOS Preview

If you don't have fancy image editing tools such as Photoshop or Gimp on macOS to blur content of an image, you can still use Preview to do so.

. Open the image with Preview.
. Select the area that you want to blur and copy it.
. Press kbd:[cmd+N] to create a new image from the copied content.
. Resize this new image to a very small size, f.e. 10 pixels, but always remain the height/width ratio.
. Copy the resized content and paste it in the original image.
. Resize the copied content to fill the area that you want to blur.
