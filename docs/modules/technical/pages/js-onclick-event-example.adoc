= Count clicks

If you have files that you can download from a page and you want to track how many times visitors have clicked the download link, you can add a small piece of Javascript and call it in the hyperlink definition.

The JS to be added to your page:

[soruce,js]
----
include::example$js-onclick-event.js[]
----

A regular hyperlink has the following format:

----
<a href="https://www.example.com">Your text here</a>
----

Now you can add an `onclick` argument that calls the Javascript function, in the above example, the function is called `sendEvent`.

----
<a onclick="sendEvent('your custom param')" href="https://www.example.com">Your text here</a>
----
