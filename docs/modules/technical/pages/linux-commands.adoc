= Linux Commands

== SSH

* Connect to ssh via a specific port:
+
====
ssh -p <port> <user>@<ip address>
====

* Connect to ssh without having to enter the password:
+
====
ssh-copy-id -i path/to/id_rsa.pub user@ipaddress
====
+
The longer version of this is:
+
====
. Copy the .pub file to your target machine.
. On the target machine: `cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
====


== Run commands on files in a directory

====
for f in *.svg; do svg2png -w 250 -h 250 $f `basename $f .svg`.png; done
====

where `basename $f .svg`.png replaces the original extension by a new extension, in this example from svg to png.
